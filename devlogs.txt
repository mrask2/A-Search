Dev Log 11/26: 
Over break, we did not work on the project much. However, we accomplished a lot when we got back to campus. We were able to accomplish 
our goals.

First off, we restructured the databases. Instead of the previous use of 1s and 0s to represent a grid, we now are using numbers 0-9,
where 0s represent the start and endpoints of the grid, and numbers 1-9 represent the weights of travelling to that point on the grid.
We have generated new data using the same website we used before, but this time using the new grid format.


Second of all, we have completed the Point class. Points represent each point on the grid. We have defined constructors, private member
variables, and comparison operators for the Point class. We have also created getters and setter for their h,g, and f values, as well as created 
a function to calculate the h value. We have also defined functions such as setCameFrom and getCameFrom in order to be able to retrace the path 
created by the solveMaze function.
    We have also created the grid class to represent the grid that the algorithm is traversing. This  class contains the main A*-Search function,
    as well as taking in a file and creating a maze from it.


Finally, we have restructured the test cases to fit our new format. We are currently running into a linker error, which I am not sure how to fix.
Our goals for next week include fixing the linker error, debugging the functions, passing our created test cases, and possibly importing a map
dataset so that we can run our algorithm on street data (our final goal).
